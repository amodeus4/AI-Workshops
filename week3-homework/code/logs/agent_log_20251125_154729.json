      "content": "Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are native to South America and are typically found in a variety of habitats, primarily near water sources. They inhabit regions such as grasslands, savannas, and tropical rainforests. Capybaras are highly adaptable animals and are commonly found in low-lying areas around rivers, lakes, ponds, and marshes.\n\nTheir range includes several countries in South America, most notably Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, and Paraguay. Because they are semi-aquatic, they rely on water for their survival and are often seen swimming or submerged to evade predators.\n\nReferences:\n- Capybara - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara\n- Hydrochoerinae - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerinae"
